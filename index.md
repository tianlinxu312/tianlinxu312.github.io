I am a final year PhD student of Statistics at London School of Economics. I'm jointly supervised by [Dr. Wicher Bergsma](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Wicher-Bergsma) and [Prof. Beatrice Acciaio](http://beatrice-acciaio.net/). 
My research interests lie in deep generative models and computer vision.
