I am a final year PhD student of Statistics at London School of Economics, jointly supervised by [Dr. Wicher Bergsma](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Wicher-Bergsma) and [Prof. Beatrice Acciaio](http://beatrice-acciaio.net/). Before starting my PhD, I did my undergraduate study in Computer Science and masters in Mathematical Finance. My current research interests lie in deep generative models and computer vision, with a focus on the spatio-temporal domain.
